****Implementations in BigRidge *****
--> Why is countmin sketch much slower than all other methods? Double check implementation
--> find and test efficient way of flipping signs in rows of A for countmin sketch and radamacher. Does flipping the signs help?
--> Compare the new theoretical bounds on batching converges rate with the imperical convergence rate.
--> Try and implement a new sparse sketch as detailed in: papers/sparse_sketches.pdf
--> Think about using a stochastic estimate of the inverse matrix, see Chapter 3 in my thesis.


****Rapport*****
--> Start filling the report with more words, and increasing legibility so we can start improving the writing.
--> Please write all the steps of the proof/computation of corollary 4.3.1, including lemma on eigenvalues of cI+vv^T (constand times identity + symmetric rank 1 matrix)
--> Try and tighten corollary 4.3.1 by considering D =I. Find out what are the most "lax" steps or inequalities. 
--> Try and extend  corollary 4.3.1 to subsampled sparse shuffling sketching.
